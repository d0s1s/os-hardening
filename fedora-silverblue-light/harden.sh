# harden.sh — Light hardening for vanilla Fedora Silverblue
#
# Platform  : Fedora Silverblue (vanilla — no secureblue rebase required)
# Purpose   : Low-friction hardening baseline: default-deny inbound firewall,
#             mask unnecessary/insecure services, sysctl network hardening,
#             DHCP hostname suppression, and MAC address randomization.
#             All changes are written to /etc or applied via systemctl/firewall-cmd —
#             no /usr writes (respects the immutable base layer).
# Tested on : Fedora Silverblue 41
# Requires  : root, Fedora Silverblue (or any Fedora Atomic variant), internet
#             access is NOT required
#
# Usage:
#   sudo bash harden.sh [--dry-run] [--skip SECTION]
#
# Skip sections (--skip, comma-separated):
#   firewall, services, sysctl, dhcp, mac, abrt, cockpit, amt, monitor
#
# Sections applied:
#   1. Firewall      — Set default firewalld zone to drop (default-deny inbound)
#   2. Services      — Mask avahi-daemon, rpcbind, geoclue, ModemManager
#   3. Sysctl        — Network stack and kernel hardening parameters
#   4. DHCP          — Suppress hostname leakage on LAN
#   5. MAC           — Per-connection MAC address randomization
#   6. ABRT          — Mask Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (crash data collection)
#   7. Cockpit       — Mask web-based remote administration console
#
# Verification:
#   Firewall  : firewall-cmd --get-default-zone  (should show "drop")
#               firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=drop
#   Services  : systemctl is-enabled avahi-daemon.service
#   Sysctl    : sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects
#   DHCP      : cat /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-secure-oss-light-dhcp.conf
#   MAC       : nmcli -f GENERAL.HWADDR,802-11-wireless.mac-address-randomization dev show
#   ABRT      : systemctl is-enabled abrtd.service  (should show "masked")
#   Cockpit   : systemctl is-enabled cockpit.socket  (should show "masked")

#
# Firewalld's "drop" zone silently drops all unsolicited inbound packets.
# Established/related return traffic (e.g. your browser responses) is handled
# by conntrack and is NOT affected — outbound-initiated connections work normally.
# IPv4 DHCP works via conntrack (kernel tracks the DISCOVER/OFFER exchange).
# We explicitly add dhcpv6-client to the drop zone to support IPv6 SLAAC/DHCPv6.
#
# Why "drop" vs "block": "drop" silently discards packets; "block" sends
# ICMP unreachable back to the sender. Drop is preferable for security — it
# provides no information to port scanners about which ports exist.

# These services are either rarely needed on a personal Silverblue desktop or

#   avahi-daemon   mDNS/DNS-SD responder. Announces the device on the local
#                  network by hostname, enabling passive device tracking and
#                  name-based enumeration. Not required for typical desktop use.
#                  (System DNS and manual /etc/hosts entries cover local needs.)
#
#   rpcbind        RPC portmapper. Required only for NFS. Exposes an open port
#                  and is a historic source of vulnerabilities. Masked unless
#                  you use NFS mounts.
#
#   geoclue        Location services daemon. Provides GPS/Wi-Fi location data
#                  to applications. Unnecessary if you don't use location-aware
#                  apps, and a potential privacy concern.
#
#   ModemManager   Mobile broadband modem manager. Unnecessary on systems
#                  without a cellular modem. Adds D-Bus surface and auto-probes
#                  serial ports.

# Section 8: Intel ME/AMT hardening
#
# Intel Management Engine (ME) is a separate microcontroller running at
# Ring -3, independent of the OS. AMT (Active Management Technology) is
# an ME feature providing out-of-band remote management reachable even
# when the OS is off or crashed.
#
# ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
# │  HARD LIMIT — what OS-level hardening CANNOT do:                │
# │                                                                  │
# │  In shared-NIC mode, AMT intercepts TCP/UDP packets on its ports │
# │  BEFORE the kernel network stack sees them. firewalld rules DO  │
# │  NOT block network-level AMT access.                            │
# │                                                                  │
# │  Primary mitigation: disable AMT/ME in BIOS/MEBx, then apply   │
# │  Intel firmware updates (INTEL-SA security advisories).         │
# └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
#
# What this section achieves:
#   1. Blacklists mei_me and mei_wdt kernel modules — severs the kernel's
#      channel to the ME firmware (requires reboot)
#   2. Checks whether AMT ports are visible in the OS network stack
#   3. Deploys a monitor that alerts if mei_me is (re-)loaded or AMT

# Section 9: MDM/RMM intrusion monitoring
#
# Deploys a timer-based monitor (poll every 2 minutes) that detects signs of
# MDM enrollment or remote management tool installation. No extra packages are
# required — Silverblue's immutable base means inotify-tools can only be added
# via rpm-ostree layering, so this uses checksum-based polling instead.
#
# Detects:
#   - Changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config, /etc/sudoers, /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
#     (baseline recorded on first run, alerts if checksum changes)
#   - New systemd service files created in /etc/systemd/system/
#   - Known RMM/remote-management process names (TeamViewer, AnyDesk, etc.)
#
# Alerts via: wall (all terminals) + logger (journal) + notify-send (desktop)
# State (checksum baselines) stored in: /var/lib/secure-oss-light/monitor/
#
# Verification:
#   systemctl status secure-oss-light-monitor.timer
